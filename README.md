# SYMMETRY FUNCTION 
a simple code example for symmetry function fitting 
## To Do

+ [X] find out the G4 descriptor sum equation
+ [X] find out the relationship with symmetry function and atomic energies
+ [X] find out the atomic nerual network in atomic energies
+ [X] [improve the accuracy into chemical accuracy](accuracy.png)
+ [ ] combine with more chemical properties
